I have made a simple project, which started of as an idea to making a bigger one.
I wanted to make a single index that would determine by which amount or percentage will the city prosper.
I am generally newish to programming and projects, so I rely on internet and AI as helpers. I avoid using AI as a "worker", but rather as a teacher. Whatever it suggests or writes, I try to understand before using.
I will try and expend this project further, I found it fun and creative.
